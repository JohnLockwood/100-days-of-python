# Day 08 - A Jupyter Notebook Example

This is a simple Jupyter Notebook Random Walk example I did for the article, [Python Tools -- The Best Tools for Learning and Development](https://codesolid.com/python-tools-the-best-tools-for-learning-and-development/)

There's also a Jupyter Lab workspace from the same article.

## Usage

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then 
```
.venv/bin/jupyter notebook RandomWalk.ipynb
```

or 
```
.venv/bin/jupyter lab lab.jupyterlab-workspace
```
