# Day 1 - Which of the Following is Not an Object in Python

I posted a fun Python puzzle as a [poll on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codesolid_activity-6876639846971015168-Sd-l/) where I asked folks to guess which of several things was not an object in Python.

Today I thought it would be fun to record a video to share how I discovered the answer.  Once I knew the answer, of course, writing the poll was the easy part.

Spoiler alert, the video uses one of my favorite exploratory Python functions.

Here again is the original poll:

## Which of the following is NOT an object in Python?

* String literals
* Operators:  Winner winner, chicken dinner!
* Number literals
* Docstring comments

## Watch the video on Youtube
