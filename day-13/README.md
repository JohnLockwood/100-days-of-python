# Day 13 How To Compare Python Dictionaries

This is day 13 of my [100 Days of Python](https://codesolid.com/zen-of-100-days-of-python/).

The DictionaryCompare directory contains the Spyder project code for my article on [How to Compare Python Dictionaries](https://codesolid.com/how-to-compare-python-dictionaries/), which goes into how Python is consistent across types for operations such as checking equality with "==".  The article is a better resource than the project directory, I would think, but it's here by way of having a place for it to live.
