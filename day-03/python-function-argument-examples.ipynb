    "Python functions have a relatively simple syntax that is very beginner-friendly.  If you're at the start of your Python journey, that may be all you need to practice.  However, as you go deeper into the language, you'll learn that compared to other programming languages, Python has a very rich and flexible syntax for calling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great news about this flexibility is that -- done right -- it supports functions that are both easy to use and maintainable over time without breaking existing callers.  The downside of course is that it can take a little work to master the many options that are available.  This is especially true now, since Python 3 has added many great enhancements, such as keyword only arguments (Python 3.0) and positional only arguments (Python 3.8).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this article -- which we'll likely break into a few parts -- is to start with the simplest information about Python function arguments and some basic background on Python functions that we hope beginners will find useful, and gradually introduce many, many examples of the Python function calling convention"

Well, although the terms \"argument\" and \"parameter\" are sometimes used interchangeably, formally speaking, a function is designed to take zero or more parameters, which the caller then passes as arguments.  Parameters have names, but the name the caller uses to call the function can be different, or -- if you're calling the function with a literal value -- you may not have a name on the caller side at all.\n",
