# 100 Days of Python


* [Day 1 -- Python Object Puzzle](day-01/README.md) 
What sorts of things in Python are not an object?  Find out in the Youtube video.

* [Day 2 -- Python function arguments](day-02/README.md).
I post Part One of my Article on Python Function Arguments

* [Day 3 -- Python function arguments, continued](day-03/README.md).
This was originally part 2 of the Python function arguments article, but as it turned out I consolidated
them both into one article.

...

* [Day 8 -- Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab samples](day-08/README.md).
Sample Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab demo for a random walk plotted with matplotlib, posted in the CodeSolid [Python Tools](https://codesolid.com/python-tools-the-best-tools-for-learning-and-development/) article.
